# Business-Analytics
There is an Excel document in which we have provided you with a report, containing information about each of the users we have delivered to the advertiser. The report is for a specific partner, over a specific period of time. With the help of this report you should answer the following questions:

1. Taking into consideration the various targeting possibilities (Networks, Age Groups,Genders and OS Versions) and based on Return on Investment on Day 7 (ROI D7), what was the best-performing audience segment (i.e. ideal user profile) in the US? Keep in mind that from your suggestion it will depend where Publisher will invest their millions from marketing budgets for this game.
TIP: ROI = (Revenue / Expenditures) *100%
2. If the advertiser’s ROI D7 goal is 4%, which audience segment(s)/groups would you recommend them to target in the US (meaning that other groups would be paused after your suggestion)? Explain your answer. Try to be as efficient as possible to deliver the expected performance to the advertiser and keep adjoe revenues as high
as possible.
3. Which audience segment(s) could be sold for a higher price (higher CPI) so that company’s revenue could increase? Explain your answer.
